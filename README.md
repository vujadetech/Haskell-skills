No, not [Eddie Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nvclk4p6Wo), Haskell Curry, although "Eddie Haskell Curry" would make for a good before-and-after puzzle on Wheel of Fortune. Just be sure to [pronounce it correctly!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja7rr91C6CQ&feature=youtu.be&t=0m34s) Of course, with my luck, if I ever were a guest on Wheel I'd prolly get stuck with a before-and-after like "The Prophet Moses [Sch√∂nfinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sch%C3%B6nfinkel)." Anyhoo, the Haskell-skills repo just has a bunch of different Haskell folders in it, I hope you enjoy it!
