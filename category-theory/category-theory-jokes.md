### Category theory jokes

- Is [Scattergories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergories) a category? If yes, provide a proof and otherwise, a counterexample. 

- Funk doors for functional programming

- _Func_ in the __thunk__! (Or is it _thunk_ in the __func__?)

- "A natural transformation is more naturally called a __morphism of funtors__ or a __functor morphism__." (_Notes on Category Theory_, Knighten, p97)
	- So would that then mean that the phrase "natural transformation" is in fact _unnatural_? HEY-oh!
