### Category theory jokes

- Is [Scattergories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergories) a category? If yes, provide a proof and otherwise, a counterexample. 

- Funk doors for functional programming

- _Func_ in the __thunk__! (Or is it _thunk_ in the __func__?)

- "A natural transformation is more naturally called a __morphism of funtors__ or a __functor morphism__." (_Notes on Category Theory_, Knighten, p97)
	- So would that then mean that the phrase "natural transformation" is in fact _unnatural_? HEY-oh!
	
- That proof was so sloppy ...
_How sloppy was it?_
The professor wasn't just doing [hand-waving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-waving), but _jazz hands_ waving. BOO-yah!

- Did you hear that professor Funkdoor went to the hospital?
_Really? What happened?_
He was doing so much hand-waving while presenting his paper at a conference that he sprained both of his wrists. 

- _[Shoot that monic arrow through my caaaaategoryyyyyy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a70yJwgQtzo)_

- ccc is a Cartesian Closed Category, not to be confused with _[C+C Music Factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaTGrV58wec)_.

- If you're accustomed to imperative programming, getting used to  functional style coding can really throw you for a _loop_.

- In functional style, you won't get to write as many __loops__, and that may make you __loopy__!

- If you want to be successful in computer science, it's __imperative__ that you learn __functional programming__. Conversely, to __function__ well you will still need to know __imperative__. However, learning __category theory__ isn't a [__categorical imperative__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative). In fact, studying too much category theory could drive you [__categorially insane__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RijB8wnJCN0)!
