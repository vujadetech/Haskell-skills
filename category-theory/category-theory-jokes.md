### Category theory jokes

- Is [Scattergories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergories) a category? If yes, provide a proof and otherwise, a counterexample. 

- Funk doors for functional programming

- _Func_ in the __thunk__! (Or is it _thunk_ in the __func__?)

- "A natural transformation is more naturally called a __morphism of funtors__ or a __functor morphism__." (_Notes on Category Theory_, Knighten, p97)
	- So would that then mean that the phrase "natural transformation" is in fact _unnatural_? HEY-oh!
	
- That proof was so sloppy ...
_How sloppy was it?_
The professor wasn't just doing [hand-waving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-waving), but _jazz hands_ waving. BOO-yah!

- Did you hear that professor Funkdoor went to the hospital?
_Really? What happened?_
He was doing so much hand-waving while presenting his paper at a conference that he sprained both of his wrists. 

- _[Shoot that monic arrow through my caaaaategoryyyyyy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a70yJwgQtzo)_

- ccc is a Cartesian Closed Category, not to be confused with _[C+C Music Factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaTGrV58wec)_.

- If you're accustomed to imperative programming, getting used to  functional style coding can really throw you for a _loop_.

- In functional style, you won't get to write as many __loops__, and that may make you __loopy__!

- If you want to be successful in computer science, it's __imperative__ that you learn __functional programming__. Conversely, to __function__ well you will still need to know __imperative__. However, learning __category theory__ isn't a [__categorical imperative__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative). In fact, studying too much category theory could drive you [__categorially insane__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RijB8wnJCN0)!

- Fancy word Friday: _modulo_
	- Ok, when [certain eggheads and know-it-alls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTjHf77FqTI) use a word like _modulo_ - not that they used it there but Harris did at one point in a different interview, I just couldn't find the clip - which originated in mathematics but can make sense figuratively in non-technical areas, it's because they want to emphasize that two different things can be considered equal even though they're not by ignoring trivial differences that aren't relevant in a given context. For example, an analog wall (standard 12 hour) clock simply says, say, 8. But is it 8am or 8pm? Is it time to leave for work or watch _Game of Thrones_? Or is that the right time for that show? Honestly, why don't you just [get Netflix so you can watch something amazing whenever you feel like it](https://www.netflix.com/title/80095815)? But I digress. Time for some ...
	- __Examples__:
		- Larry David's show-in-a-show _Sour Grapes_ was, according to his wife Cheryl's friend, "the perfect length."
		- [John Belushi/Dan Akroyd _Olympia Restaurant_ skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puJePACBoIo), "No coke, pepsi; no fries, cheeps"
		- Oh, I forgot to finish the clock example, sorry. So, where were we? Ah, yes: 
		- Darin from Bewitched
		- [Eminem's Boy Band construction algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QOya9-lwQk&feature=youtu.be&t=9m40s) - no Eminem wasn't flirting with Weird Al Yankovic, although the "interview" is hilarious, you know what I'm sayin'?

#### More hilarious jokes
- [Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code), not to be confused with the _Gary Code_, which are the rules governing the Gary, Indiana based [Fight Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club).

- Visual Basic 1.0 was a dependently typed concurrent pure total functional programming language. Ponder on this: [why was Steve Ballmer always so excited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I14b-C67EXY)? Ballmer and Gates' private phrase was "Unused names are written dimly, but they do need to be there," or when they were in a hurry, for example when Ballmer was backstage at a MS event clearing coat racks like track hurdles en route to give a pep scream to a few thousand MS employees, simply "Dim names." And how does one create a variable in VB? "Dim aMAYzing", amirite? 

- Redo wonder showzen ["Patience", but find the original interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sltSm5mUniw) but with Friedman's "Why can't we have recursion?" joke. 

- Ballmer, ballmering (verb, gerund), Defn: like [Jack Donaghy's _Reaganing_ from _30 Rock_](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=30+rock+reaganing), but with Steve Ballmer instead of Ronald Reagan.

- The Idris programming language was created by British actor Idris Elba, who was inspired to enter the tech world because Ashton Kutcher had done it, so how hard can it be? Idris is a purely functional, dependently typed programming language, so it is real eye-opener for somone with a background in imperative languages like Java/C++. If you've never coded in a functional language before, when you begin working with Idris you'll be stunned to realize that a black person can have a british accent. So here's one for you to scratch off today's todo list: _Mind blown_.
