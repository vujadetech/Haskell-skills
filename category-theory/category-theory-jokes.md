### Category theory jokes [in progress]

- Is [Scattergories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergories) a category? If yes, provide a proof and otherwise, a counterexample. 

- Funk doors for functional programming

- _Func_ in the __thunk__! (Or is it _thunk_ in the __func__?)

- "A natural transformation is more naturally called a __morphism of funtors__ or a __functor morphism__." (_Notes on Category Theory_, Knighten, p97)
	- So would that then mean that the phrase "natural transformation" is in fact _unnatural_? HEY-oh!
	
- That proof was so sloppy ...
_How sloppy was it?_
The professor wasn't just doing [hand-waving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-waving), but _jazz hands_ waving. BOO-yah!

- Did you hear that professor Funkdoor went to the hospital?
_Really? What happened?_
He was doing so much hand-waving while presenting his paper at a conference that he sprained both of his wrists. 

- _[Shoot that monic arrow through my caaaaategoryyyyyy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a70yJwgQtzo)_

- ccc is a Cartesian Closed Category, not to be confused with _[C+C Music Factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaTGrV58wec)_.

- If you're accustomed to imperative programming, getting used to  functional style coding can really throw you for a _loop_.

- In functional style, you won't get to write as many __loops__, and that may make you __loopy__!

- If you want to be successful in computer science, it's __imperative__ that you learn __functional programming__. Conversely, to __function__ well you will still need to know __imperative__. However, learning __category theory__ isn't a [__categorical imperative__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative). In fact, studying too much category theory could drive you [__categorially insane__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RijB8wnJCN0)!

- Fancy word Friday: _modulo_
	- Ok, when [certain eggheads and know-it-alls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTjHf77FqTI) use a word like _modulo_ - not that they used it there but Harris did at one point in a different interview, I just couldn't find the clip - which originated in mathematics but can make sense figuratively in non-technical areas, it's because they want to emphasize that two different things can be considered equal even though they're not by ignoring trivial differences that aren't relevant in a given context. For example, an analog wall (standard 12 hour) clock simply says, say, 8. But is it 8am or 8pm? Is it time to leave for work or watch _Game of Thrones_? Or is that the right time for that show? Honestly, why don't you just [get Netflix so you can watch something amazing whenever you feel like it](https://www.netflix.com/title/80095815)? But I digress. Time for some ...
	- __Examples__:
		- Larry David's show-in-a-show _Sour Grapes_ was, according to his wife Cheryl's friend, "the perfect length."
		- [John Belushi/Dan Akroyd _Olympia Restaurant_ skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puJePACBoIo), "No coke, pepsi; no fries, cheeps"
		- Oh, I forgot to finish the clock example, sorry. So, where were we? Ah, yes: 
		- Darin from Bewitched
		- [Eminem's Boy Band construction algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QOya9-lwQk&feature=youtu.be&t=9m40s) - no Eminem wasn't flirting with Weird Al Yankovic, although the "interview" is hilarious, you know what I'm sayin'?
		- Memes = (famous quote/movie line/song lyric/etc) modulo (a common experience but in a different area than the original)

#### More hilarious jokes
- [Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code), not to be confused with _The Gary Code_, which is the set of rules governing the Gary, Indiana based [Fight Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club).

- _Visual Basic 1.0_ was a _dependently typed, concurrent, pure and total functional programming language_. Ponder on this: [why was Steve Ballmer always so excited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I14b-C67EXY)? Ballmer and Gates' private phrase was "Unused names are written dimly, but they do need to be there," or when they were in a hurry, for example when Ballmer was backstage at an MS event clearing coat racks like track hurdles en route to give a pep scream to a few thousand MS employees, simply "Dim names." And how does one create a variable in VB? "Dim aMAYzing", amirite? 

- Redo wonder showzen ["Patience", but find the original interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sltSm5mUniw) but with Friedman's "Why can't we have recursion?" joke. 

- Ballmer, ballmering (verb, gerund), Defn: like [Jack Donaghy's _Reaganing_ from _30 Rock_](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=30+rock+reaganing), but with Steve Ballmer instead of Ronald Reagan.

- The [Idris programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_(programming_language)) was created by [British actor Idris Elba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_Elba), who was inspired to enter the tech world because Ashton Kutcher had done it, so how hard can it be? Idris is a purely functional, dependently typed programming language, so it's a real eye-opener for someone with a background in imperative programming. If you've never coded in a functional language before, when you begin working with Idris you'll be stunned to realize that a black person can have a british accent. So here's one for you to scratch off today's todo list: _Mind blown_.

- Skit: [Two professors finishing a chat with lots of word salad since the paper is on the efficient implementation of second order logic in dependently typed programming languages]
	- [As other prof leaves, the secretary comes to the door] 
	- _Professor Funkdoor, would you like me to show you how to use your Amazon kindle now?_
	- Actually I think I do this on my own. I got my Ph.D. from Stanford in the semantics of programming languages, how hard can it be to figure out a kindle?
	- [several minutes later is still fumbling to get it turned on]
	
	
### Top 5 programming languages to learn in 2020
1. Type theory
	- No surprises here, type theory has had solid rankings on the TIOBE index since its inception in the 1920s. [russell style contradictions] That sort of contradiction could have undermined every algorithm in computer science. Luckily there were no physical computers in the 1920s, just theoretical models, so it wasn't a big deal. 
2. Type theory
3. In third place is newcomer typ thry. It's still type theory, but it's stylized that way b/c apparently everything becomes hipper when you get rid of the vowels.
4. Type theory
5. Last year's fourth place holder type theory is now in 5th place. Type theory has been inching its way down the rankings for several years straight, leading some to deride type theory as a dead theory, or at least a theory that deserves to die. Nevertheless, type theory has tenaciously hung on. As type theory is part of the compositional glue that binds functional code together, it's been called "the duct tape of the lambda calculus."

So there you have it, 5 outstanding type theory. Which type theory do you plan to learn next?
 
##### Kurt Godel showed that formulas can gossip about each other. So they could, for example, have their own TMZ. 
- [Godel numbering] ...


#### Generic jokes, yuks and laffs (not category theory specific, but hopefully as or more hilarious, or nearly as much, one can only hope)

- Definition of _homomorphism_: In abstract algebra and category theory, a  _homomorphism_ is a ... you know what, it doesn't matter what a homomorphism is because whatever that morphism does with his partner in the privacy of his own functor is his own business.

- Open source software, not to be confused with: open source softwear, open sores software, open sores softwear, or "Open sores, soft where?"

- Primitive recursion is harder than 3 times 9, I teh u wut.

- (not a joke so much as a non-humorous observation) Sir Isaac Newton, and Gottfried Leibniz are gonna feel so stupid when they find out that no one cares about calculus anymore because now it's all about discrete math, type theory and functional programming.

#### Memes: b/c there is a dangerous shortage of memes on the interwebs

- Sarcastic Wonka
	- Oh, you wrote a functor in Haskell? Please prattle on about your doctoral research in category theory.
	- Oh, you know what a monad is? Please accept this ACM Turing award and Gödel Prize.
	- Oh, you understand recursion? Please read this meme again.
	- Oh, you wrote a recursive algorithm? Please tell me more about fixed-point combinators.

- Fishburne matrix "What if I told you..."
	- ... functional and OO programming are compatible
	- ... an OO system forms a [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) where the objects are classes and the [morphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism) are messages passed between class instances
	- ... functional programming was invented by mathematicians in the 1920s
	- ... linear algebra involves much more than just matrices (so much so that it is sometimes affectionally chided as being [abstract nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense))
	- ... all of OOP can be simulated in a functional language like Scheme
	- ... OOP was originally designed so that the emphasis should be on _the messages between objects_, not _the objects themselves_
	- ... an arrow in category theory isn't necessarily a function
	- ... monads don't have a damn thing to do with burritos
	- ... there's more than one definition of randomness
	- ... the sequence "1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1" could be considered random
	- ... solid objects are composed primarily of empty space
	- ... at the level of atomic particles, nature is fundamentally random
	- ... mathematics existed for millenia before the introduction of probability theory, and when it was introduced it was considered heretical, and even to this day there isn't complete agreement on what constitutes randomness owing to subtleties in the differences of randomness as defined by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers like Kolmogorov, Martin-Löf, Chaitin, Church and Borel
	- ... randomness in quantum mechanics isn't mutually exclusive with [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) in philosophy
	- ... religious/spiritual belief is contradicted neither by biological evolution nor by philosophical determinism
	- ... Charles Darwin was a minister before he became a biologist
	- ... if a baby alligator is flushed down the toilet, it won't grow up to become a giant alligator that lives inside the sewer system
	- ... technically, Jesus was a zombie
	- ... [vulnerability doesn't betray weakness, but strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o)
	- ... someone who suggests that the best way to learn algorithms is to read the [CLRS book](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Press-Thomas-Cormen-ebook/dp/B007CNRCAO/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=clrs+algorithm&qid=1561076115&s=gateway&sr=8-2) probably hasn't
	- ... a function with return type _void_ in C language doesn't return __nothing__; rather, it returns __one thing__, namely, the single instance of the unit type, which in C language is (confusingly, given its meaning elsewhere in type theory) called _void_
	- ... since classes in OO languages can specify member functions, and object instances of a class can be passed as parameters, which means their member functions are also passed as (sub)parameters, then just as functional languages have functions as first-class citizens, OO languages do as well
	- ... in _Genesis_ it didn't say that Eve at an apple, only that she ate a piece of fruit.
	- ... [Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology) didn't coin the phrase "the whole is _greater than_ the sum of its parts," but he did say "the whole is _something else_ than the sum of its parts."
	- ... Jesus was jewish
	- ... the entirety of mathematics is predicated on axioms, which are statements that are given without proof, and yet presumed to be true by the very definition of the word "axiom."
