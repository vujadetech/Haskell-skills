### Category theory jokes

- Is [Scattergories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattergories) a category? If yes, provide a proof and otherwise, a counterexample. 

- Funk doors for functional programming

- _Func_ in the __thunk__! (Or is it _thunk_ in the __func__?)

- "A natural transformation is more naturally called a __morphism of funtors__ or a __functor morphism__." (_Notes on Category Theory_, Knighten, p97)
	- So would that then mean that the phrase "natural transformation" is in fact _unnatural_? HEY-oh!
	
- That proof was so sloppy ...
_How sloppy was it?_
The professor wasn't just doing [hand-waving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-waving), but _jazz hands_ waving. BOO-yah!

- Did you hear that professor Funkdoor went to the hospital?
_Really? What happened?_
He was doing so much hand-waving while presenting his paper at a conference that he sprained both of his wrists. 

- _[Shoot that monic arrow through my caaaaategoryyyyyy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a70yJwgQtzo)_

- ccc is a Cartesian Closed Category, not to be confused with _[C+C Music Factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaTGrV58wec)_.

- If you're accustomed to imperative programming, getting used to  functional style coding can really throw you for a _loop_.

- In functional style, you won't get to write as many __loops__, and that may make you __loopy__!

- If you want to be successful in computer science, it's __imperative__ that you learn __functional programming__. Conversely, to __function__ well you will still need to know __imperative__. However, learning __category theory__ isn't a [__categorical imperative__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative). In fact, studying too much category theory could drive you [__categorially insane__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RijB8wnJCN0)!

- Fancy word Friday: _modulo_
	- Ok, when [certain eggheads and know-it-alls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTjHf77FqTI) use a word like _modulo_ - not that they used it there but Harris did at one point in a different interview, I just couldn't find the clip - which originated in mathematics but can make sense figuratively in non-technical areas, it's because they want to emphasize that two different things can be considered equal even though they're not by ignoring trivial differences that aren't relevant in a given context. For example, an analog wall (standard 12 hour) clock simply says, say, 8. But is it 8am or 8pm? Is it time to leave for work or watch _Game of Thrones_? Or is that the right time for that show? Honestly, why don't you just [get Netflix so you can watch something amazing whenever you feel like it](https://www.netflix.com/title/80095815)? But I digress. Time for some ...
	- __Examples__:
		- Larry David's show-in-a-show _Sour Grapes_ was, according to his wife Cheryl's friend, "the perfect length."
		- [John Belushi/Dan Akroyd _Olympia Restaurant_ skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puJePACBoIo), "No coke, pepsi; no fries, cheeps"
		- Oh, I forgot to finish the clock example, sorry. So, where were we? Ah, yes: 
		- Darin from Bewitched
		- [Eminem's Boy Band construction algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QOya9-lwQk&feature=youtu.be&t=9m40s) - no Eminem wasn't flirting with Weird Al Yankovic, although the "interview" is hilarious, you know what I'm sayin'?

#### More hilarious jokes
- [Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code), not to be confused with the _Gary Code_, which are the rules governing the Gary, Indiana based [Fight Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club).
