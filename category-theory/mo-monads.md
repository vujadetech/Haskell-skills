### Mo' Monads: the interwebs' very best monad stuff [in progress]

- The best meta-monad tutorial, besides this one, obviously :D, is John D. Cook's [Monad's are hard because...](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/03/03/monads-are-hard-because/). In fact, it's what inspired me to post this list. Some of the links are redundant here, but that's not a bad thing given the noise/signal ratio for this topic.

- Wadler's [Monads for functional programming](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf)

Ok, I stole this joke from YT user Joseph X who put it in the comment section of [Graham Hutton's monad tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1e8gqXLbsU&t=2s), which belongs on this list in its own right. Hutton is also the author of the excellent Haskell book [Programming in Haskell](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hutton+haskell&qid=1559659247&s=gateway&sr=8-1).
