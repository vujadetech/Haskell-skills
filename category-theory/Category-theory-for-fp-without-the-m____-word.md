### Group categories

- Let Grp be the class of all groups (or some subset thereof). For G, K in Grp let H(G, K) be the set of all homomorphisms of G into K. Let the operator * be function composition s.t. for all f in H(G, K) and g in H(K, L), g*f is in H(G, L) is the composition of f and g. Then C_Grp can be verified to be the category of groups Grp.

##### Examples of groups (from emathzone.com)
- Let G = {1, -1, i, -i} where * is multiplication and H = (Z, +). Let f : H -> G and n in Z and define f(n) = i^n. Then f is a homomorphism from H to G. 

	Proof:
	
	- f(n + m) = i^(n + m) = i^n * i^m = f(n) * f(m).

### Functors (from wikipedia.com)

- If C and D are categories a __functor__ F from C to D is a mapping that 
	- associates each X in C an object F(X) in D (in Mendelson's terms, F1(X) in D).
	- associates to each morphism f : X -> Y in C a morphism F(f) : F(X) -> F(Y) that preserves identity morphisms and composition of morphisms, or in Mendelson's terms, F2(f):F1(X)->F1(Y).

##### Examples of functors

- Constant functor: The functor C â†’ D which maps every object of C to a fixed object X in D and every morphism in C to the identity morphism on X. Such a functor is called a constant or selection functor.

- Endofunctor: A functor that maps a category to that same category; e.g., polynomial functor.

- Identity functor: in category C, written 1C or idC, maps an object to itself and a morphism to itself. The identity functor is an endofunctor.

- Diagonal functor: The diagonal functor is defined as the functor from D to the functor category DC which sends each object in D to the constant functor at that object.

##### Jokes

These are normally called _objects_, but since that word could easily be conflated with OO programming by readers with a heavier CS than math background, we'll just call them _things_ so we don't accidentally dispatch a java programmer to go write an IFunctorable interface before we get to the good stuff.
