##### Article 2, Isomorphisms

- __Ex 1 r__ I_A serves as its own inverse since I_A . I_A = I_A. Thus I_A is an isomorphism.
- __Ex 1 s__ Spse f : A -> B is an iso(morphism) and g : B -> A is an f inverse. Then fg = I_B and gf = I_A, so g is also an iso.
- __Ex 1 t__ Since f is an iso from A to B there is a g : B -> A that is an f inverse, and likewise an h : C -> B that is a k inverse. Thus  gh : C -> A is an inverse for kf : A -> C since (gh)(kf) = g(h(kf)) = g(hk)f = g(I_B)f = gf = I_A, and similarly (kf)(gh) = I_C, so gh and kf are inverses of each other and thus both are isos.

- __Ex 2__ kf : A -> B is I_A, and gf is I_A as well. Likewise fk and fg are both I_B. So g = g I_B = g(fk) = (gf)k = I_A k = k.

- __Ex 1 R__
