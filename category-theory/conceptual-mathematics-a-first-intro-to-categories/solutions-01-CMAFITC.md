##### Article 2, Isomorphisms

- Ex 1 R: I_A serves as its own inverse since I_A . I_A = I_A. Thus I_A is an isomorphism.
- Ex 1 S: Spse f : A -> B is an iso(morphism) and g : B -> A is an f inverse. Then fg = I_B and gf = I_A, so g is also an iso.
- Ex 1 T: Since f is an iso from A to B there is a g : B -> A that is an f inverse, and likewise an h : C -> B that is a k inverse. Thus  gh : C -> A is an inverse for kf : A -> C since (gh)(kf) = g(h(kf)) = g(hk)f = g(I_B)f = gf = I_A, and similarly (kf)(gh) = I_C.
