{-
If we were defining a mapping type, we could add a typeclass constraint in
the data declaration:

data (Ord k) => Map k v = ...

However, it's a very strong convention in Haskell to never add typeclass
constraints in data declarations. Why? Well, because we don't benefit a
lot, but we end up writing more class constraints, even when we don't need them.
