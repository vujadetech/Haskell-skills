- Parody of [Jim Croce's Operator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RA4MykPm4s): "Haskell operators (that's not what 'return' does)."

- Functions are first class citizens related jokes.
	- First class functions are like the guy in the [_Grey Poupon_ commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwOCOm9Z0YE).
	
	> Pardon me, do you have any _Grey Poupon_?
	
	- Jerry Seinfeld
