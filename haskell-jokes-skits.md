# Some haskell jokes and skits for ya.

- ##### Parody of [Jim Croce's Operator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RA4MykPm4s): "Haskell operators (that's not what 'return' does)."

	> Haskell operator, help me make this function call.
	
- ##### Functions are first class citizens related jokes.
	- First class functions are like the guy in the [_Grey Poupon_ commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwOCOm9Z0YE).
	
		> Pardon me, do you have any _Grey Poupon_?
	
	- Jerry Seinfeld (not a real quote, but imagine his voice).
	
		> You got a function, you got an input, just apply the function to the input. Why do you have to pass the function as an input and get another function as the return value? I mean, come on! [Who are the ad wizards who came up with this one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_pvFXbVlt8)
	
	
- ##### Desugar haskell, oooh, dehoney dehoney (tune of the archies)

- ##### Although [monads are like burritos](https://blog.plover.com/prog/burritos.html), they have much more in common with year-round McRib sandwiches. Now there is an obvious side effect to eating too many McRib sandwiches, namely, becoming [morbidly obese](http://thatblueyak.blogspot.com/2009/06/fattest-twins-mcguire-twins-motorcycles.html).
